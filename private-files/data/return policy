Defective Policy
In an effort to provide the best customer service possible, Honey’s Place has implemented a hassle-free return policy. Products with manufacturing defects must be returned within 90 days from receipt and require a return merchandise authorization number (RMA).

Here’s how it works:

Contact your Account Manager directly with your return request.
Your Account Manager will provide an RMA # for approved items.
Pack all items to be returned in a shipping box.
Write a list of every item and place it inside the shipping box.
Write the RMA # on the outside of the shipping box to expedite the return process.
Once the return is received and processed by Honey’s Place, a credit will be issued to your account.
Honey’s Place is not responsible for lost, stolen, or damaged packages. We recommend that all packages be fully insured for your return order in the event it is lost or damaged. We recommend that you use a carrier that can provide you with proof of delivery.

Note: For customers with multiple accounts, please make sure you provide the correct account number for each item you are returning in order to receive a proper credit. Our system relies on this account number to verify when and if the items came from us.

*Credits will only be issued for items purchased from Honey’s Place. Due to the delicate nature of the items we sell, all returned items are disposed of immediately once credit has been issued.
